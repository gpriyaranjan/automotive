ID	Safety Goal	Description	ASIL	Rationale/Related Hazards
SG-001	Prevent Unintended Steering Assist	The EPS system shall not provide steering assistance contrary to the driver's intention or external commands (e.g., in ADAS/AD modes), which could lead to an unintended change in vehicle trajectory.	ASIL D	Unintended steering torque application, steering wheel jerk, sudden lane change.
SG-002	Maintain Steerability (No Loss of Assist)	The EPS system shall ensure that the driver always retains the ability to steer the vehicle, even in the event of a system fault. Loss of power steering assist (leading to high steering effort) or complete loss of steering control shall be prevented or mitigated.	ASIL D	Complete loss of steering assist, significant increase in steering effort, inability to steer the vehicle.
SG-003	Prevent Erratic or Oscillatory Steering Behavior	The EPS system shall not exhibit erratic, oscillatory, or unstable steering behavior (e.g., sudden changes in assist, vibrations, or oscillations) that could compromise vehicle stability or driver control.	ASIL D	Oscillatory steering wheel, vibrations, erratic steering response.
SG-004	Ensure Timely and Accurate Fault Indication	In the event of an EPS system malfunction, the driver shall be provided with a clear, unambiguous, and timely indication of the fault status, allowing for appropriate driver action.	ASIL B(C)	Undetected or delayed fault indication leading to hazardous situations if the driver is unaware of reduced functionality.
SG-005	Prevent Mechanical Binding or Locking of Steering	The EPS system shall not cause or contribute to any mechanical binding, jamming, or locking of the steering column or steering mechanism.	ASIL D	Steering wheel lock-up, inability to turn the steering wheel.
SG-006	Maintain Vehicle Directional Control in Degraded Mode	If the EPS system enters a degraded operating mode due to a fault, it shall ensure that the vehicle's directional control is maintained, even if steering effort increases.	ASIL C(D)	Unexpected change in steering characteristics, difficulty in maintaining lane.
SG-007	Protect Against Cyber-Attacks Affecting Steering Function	The EPS system shall be protected against unauthorized external access or manipulation that could compromise its intended steering function.	ASIL D (as per ISO 21434 for cybersecurity impact)	Remote control of steering, disabling of EPS, malicious injection of steering commands.
