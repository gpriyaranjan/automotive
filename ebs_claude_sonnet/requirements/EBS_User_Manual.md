## 4. System Operation

### 4.1 Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)

#### 4.1.1 How ABS Works
ABS prevents wheel lockup during hard braking by:
- Monitoring individual wheel speeds continuously
- Detecting when a wheel is about to lock
- Rapidly pulsing brake pressure to that wheel
- Maintaining steering control during emergency braking

#### 4.1.2 When ABS Activates
ABS activates automatically when:
- Hard braking is applied
- Road surface is slippery
- One or more wheels begin to lock
- Emergency braking situation occurs

#### 4.1.3 What You'll Experience
When ABS is active, you may notice:
- **Brake Pedal Pulsation**: Normal pulsing feeling in brake pedal
- **Noise**: Rapid clicking or buzzing sound from brake system
- **Vibration**: Slight vibration in brake pedal
- **Maintained Steering**: Ability to steer while braking hard

#### 4.1.4 Proper ABS Technique
For maximum ABS effectiveness:
1. **Apply firm, steady pressure** to brake pedal
2. **Do not pump the brakes** - ABS does this automatically
3. **Maintain steering control** - steer around obstacles if necessary
4. **Keep pressure on pedal** until vehicle stops or danger passes

### 4.2 Electronic Stability Control (ESC)

#### 4.2.1 How ESC Works
ESC helps maintain vehicle stability by:
- Continuously monitoring vehicle motion
- Comparing intended path with actual path
- Detecting understeer or oversteer conditions
- Applying individual wheel brakes to correct vehicle path
- Reducing engine power when necessary

#### 4.2.2 When ESC Activates
ESC activates when:
- Vehicle begins to skid or slide
- Cornering forces exceed tire grip limits
- Emergency steering maneuvers are performed
- Road conditions are slippery

#### 4.2.3 What You'll Experience
When ESC is active:
- **ESC Warning Lamp Flashes**: Indicates system is working
- **Brake Application**: Individual wheels may be braked
- **Engine Power Reduction**: Engine power may be reduced
- **Steering Feel**: Slight change in steering feel
- **Vehicle Correction**: Vehicle path will be corrected

#### 4.2.4 ESC Driving Tips
To work effectively with ESC:
- **Reduce speed** when ESC activates frequently
- **Smooth inputs** - avoid sudden steering or throttle changes
- **Maintain control** - ESC assists but doesn't replace good driving
- **Adjust driving** for road conditions

### 4.3 Traction Control System (TCS)

#### 4.3.1 How TCS Works
TCS prevents wheel spin by:
- Monitoring wheel speeds during acceleration
- Detecting when drive wheels begin to spin
- Applying brakes to spinning wheels
- Reducing engine power to maintain traction

#### 4.3.2 When TCS Activates
TCS activates when:
- Accelerating on slippery surfaces
- One or more drive wheels begin to spin
- Starting from a stop on ice or snow
- Accelerating through puddles or loose surfaces

#### 4.3.3 What You'll Experience
When TCS is active:
- **ESC Warning Lamp Flashes**: Indicates TCS operation
- **Reduced Acceleration**: Engine power may be limited
- **Brake Noise**: Brief brake application sounds
- **Improved Traction**: Better grip and forward motion

#### 4.3.4 TCS Driving Tips
For best TCS performance:
- **Gentle acceleration** on slippery surfaces
- **Allow system to work** - don't fight the system
- **Reduce speed** if TCS activates frequently
- **Use appropriate tires** for conditions

### 4.4 ESC OFF Switch

#### 4.4.1 ESC OFF Function
Your vehicle may be equipped with an ESC OFF switch that:
- Allows partial or complete ESC system disable
- May be necessary for specific driving situations
- Should only be used when absolutely necessary
- Automatically re-enables at next ignition cycle

#### 4.4.2 When to Use ESC OFF
ESC OFF may be helpful when:
- **Stuck in snow or mud**: Allows controlled wheel spin for traction
- **Using snow chains**: Prevents interference with chain operation
- **Off-road driving**: Allows controlled sliding in appropriate situations
- **Rocking vehicle**: Permits rocking motion to get unstuck

#### 4.4.3 ESC OFF Procedure
To disable ESC (if equipped):
1. **Press and hold ESC OFF button** for 3 seconds
2. **ESC OFF lamp illuminates** confirming system is disabled
3. **ABS remains active** - only ESC/TCS functions are disabled
4. **System re-enables** automatically at next ignition cycle

⚠️ **WARNING**: Drive with extra caution when ESC is disabled. The vehicle's stability and traction control are reduced.
