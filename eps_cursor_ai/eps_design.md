## **Electric Power Steering (EPS) Algorithm Outline**

Electric Power Steering (EPS) is a modern automotive technology that replaces traditional hydraulic power steering systems with an electric motor to assist the driver in steering the vehicle. Unlike hydraulic systems, EPS is more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly, and allows for greater flexibility in steering feel, as well as integration with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) like lane-keeping assist and automated parking.

### **I. Key Components**

Before outlining the algorithm, it's important to understand the primary hardware components involved:

1. **Torque Sensor:** Measures the torque applied by the driver to the steering wheel. This is the primary input for determining the required assistance.  
2. **Steering Angle Sensor:** Measures the absolute angle of the steering wheel.  
3. **Vehicle Speed Sensor:** Provides the vehicle's current speed (often sourced from the ABS/EBS system or directly from the ECU).  
4. **Electric Motor:** A DC or AC motor (often a brushless DC motor) that provides the steering assistance torque.  
5. **Motor Driver / Electronic Control Unit (ECU):** The brain of the EPS system. It receives sensor inputs, executes the EPS algorithm, and controls the electric motor.  
6. **Reduction Gear / Ball Screw Mechanism:** Translates the rotational motion of the electric motor into linear force to assist the steering rack.  
7. **Battery / Power Supply:** Provides electrical energy to the EPS system.

### **II. EPS Algorithm Outline**

The EPS algorithm operates in a continuous loop, constantly monitoring driver input and vehicle speed to provide optimal steering assistance.

#### **A. Sensor Data Acquisition**

* **Step 1: Read Sensor Inputs:**  
  * Continuously read data from the torque sensor, steering angle sensor, and vehicle speed sensor at a high sampling rate.  
  * **Input Data:** tau\_driver (driver applied torque), theta\_steer (steering angle), V\_veh (vehicle speed).

#### **B. Data Processing and Analysis**

* **Step 2: Filter and Process Sensor Data:**  
  * Apply digital filters (e.g., low-pass filters) to sensor readings to remove noise and ensure stable operation.  
  * Calculate the rate of change of steering angle (steering angular velocity) if needed for advanced control.  
* **Step 3: Determine Steering Conditions:**  
  * **Driver Effort Assessment:** The primary input is the driver's applied torque.  
  * **Vehicle Speed Impact:** Vehicle speed is crucial. At low speeds (e.g., parking), more assistance is needed. At high speeds, less assistance is required for better road feel and stability.

#### **C. Assist Torque Calculation (Core Logic)**

* **Step 4: Calculate Target Assist Torque (**tau\_assist**):**  
  * **Base Assist Mapping:** Use a pre-defined map or function that relates driver torque and vehicle speed to a base assist torque. This map is carefully calibrated during vehicle development to provide the desired steering feel.  
    * Example: tau\_assist\_base=f(tau\_driver,V\_veh)  
  * **Damping Control:** Add a damping component to prevent oscillations and improve steering feel, especially during rapid steering movements. This often depends on steering angular velocity.  
  * **Inertia Compensation:** Compensate for the inertia of the steering system itself to provide a more consistent feel.  
  * **Return-to-Center (RTC) Control:** At low speeds, provide an additional assist torque to help the steering wheel return to the center position after a turn. This is often based on steering angle and vehicle speed.  
  * **Active Damping / Vibration Suppression:** Implement algorithms to actively suppress vibrations transmitted from the road to the steering wheel.  
  * **Over-assist/Under-assist Prevention:** Ensure the assist torque does not lead to an unnatural or dangerous steering feel (e.g., too light at high speed, too heavy at low speed).  
  * **Integration with ADAS:** If integrated with ADAS features (e.g., Lane Keeping Assist, Park Assist), the EPS ECU receives commands from the ADAS controller to generate specific steering torques to guide the vehicle. This overrides or modifies the driver's input.

#### **D. Motor Control**

* **Step 5: Command Electric Motor:**  
  * Convert the calculated target assist torque (tau\_assist) into a motor current or voltage command.  
  * Send this command to the motor driver.  
  * The motor driver then applies the appropriate current/voltage to the electric motor, which generates the required mechanical torque to assist the steering.  
  * This typically involves a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller or more advanced control strategies to accurately achieve the target torque.

#### **E. Feedback and Adjustment**

* **Step 6: Monitor and Iterate:**  
  * Continuously monitor the actual motor current, motor position, and the resulting steering system behavior.  
  * Use this feedback to refine the next iteration of assist torque calculations and motor commands in real-time. This forms a closed-loop control system, ensuring precise and responsive assistance.

#### **F. Fault Detection and Management**

* **Step 7: Self-Diagnosis and Error Handling:**  
  * Continuously monitor sensor functionality, motor operation, and ECU health.  
  * If a fault is detected (e.g., sensor failure, motor overcurrent, communication error), log the error, illuminate a warning light on the dashboard, and potentially revert to a failsafe mode (e.g., reduced assist or manual steering).  
  * In severe cases, the system might shut down to prevent damage, leaving the driver with unassisted (but still functional) steering.
